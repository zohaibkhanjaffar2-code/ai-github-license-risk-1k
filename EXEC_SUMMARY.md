# Executive Summary — GitHub License Risk (122k)

**Scope:** Verified 122,720 repos (HTTP 200) via GitHub API.  
**Family mix:**  
* Permissive: 70395 (57.36%)
* Unknown: 37057 (30.20%)
* Copyleft: 12155 (9.90%)
* Weak-copyleft: 2549 (2.08%)
* Public-domain: 323 (0.26%)
* Other: 241 (0.20%)

**Implications:** Permissive dominates (~57%). Unknown is material (~30%) and should be treated as “no permission” until clarified. Copyleft families (~12%) require share-alike planning.

**Actions for platforms:** (1) attribution ledger, (2) ship license texts/NOTICE, (3) gate by family, (4) periodic re-checks, (5) removal workflow, (6) publish policy.
